# AR-Maze

For now, augmented reality (AR) is still largely a novelty -- AR's newness alone contributes to its ability 
to surpass print, online, and television advertisements in terms of shock-factor.

Students today expect the classroom to be both educational and enjoyable at the same time. Getting students involved improves retention, understanding, and enjoyment. And itâ€™s remarkably easy to involve the students using traditional fun games like treasure hunt. 

Augmented Reality Maze(AR Maze) is an educational AR app which allows users to move across the maze in any direction they want. The goal of this app is to find the switches of a safe and a shield by answering few simple mathematic questions.

The AR Maze app encourages the young students to learn their courses in fun and imaginative manner by walking across the maze thereby promote walking and a healthier lifestyle.


I learned a ton about time management and managing the various errors during this application development. On technical front it was a great learning of Unity and C# script. Exploring my web development skills and presenting my whole application on internet was bug learning.
